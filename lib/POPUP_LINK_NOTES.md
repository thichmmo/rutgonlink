# Popup app link selection

Original popup Android/iOS affiliate fields remain independent and unchanged.
Android Shopee uses the original HTTPS `_blank` anchor. Android TikTok uses the
original Android HTTPS `_self` anchor, with no click-time or request-time Android
resolution. Request preparation strips legacy `androidLaunchUrl` metadata.

Fresh physical tests on 2026-10-07 found the derived `snssdk1180://ec/pdp`
candidate could open TikTok but show a product-load error, despite an earlier
successful user test. The original Android HTTPS link opened the correct shared
product card on Chrome; the native **Xem mặt hàng** button opened the complete
PDP. This is a two-gesture path, not proof of a direct native PDP fix.

When `forceChromeAndroid` is enabled, Android Facebook transfers the actual
article to Chrome before either affiliate step. See
[browser gate notes](POPUP_BROWSER_GATE_NOTES.md) for the consent and state
contract. Ordinary Android launch links are never replaced by an iOS URL.

Native intent builders remain available as compatibility helpers and preserve
the complete signed `params_url` plus the original-source fallback. They are no
longer selected by popup runtime. Their syntax tests do not prove app success.
Existing iOS Facebook short-link preparation, OneLink mode, timeout and cache
behavior remain unchanged; Android no longer shares that resolution path.

Evidence checked 2026-10-07: `/.well-known/assetlinks.json` on shopee.vn,
www.shopee.vn, s.shopee.vn; tiktok.com, www.tiktok.com, vt.tiktok.com,
vm.tiktok.com, shop.tiktok.com. Do not guess third-party custom schemes.

Verify: `node scripts/test-popup-runtime.cjs --android-check`, full runtime suite,
`node scripts/test-popup-affiliate.cjs`. Intent delivery depends on the installed
apps, Android link preferences and the embedding browser; mocked tests do not
establish native-device success.

## Facebook confirmation follow-up

The original Shopee HTTPS `_blank` link remains unchanged. Four isolated HTTPS
trials on 2026-10-07 passed on a real Android 16 phone: standalone/React through
Facebook→Chrome and both renderers directly in Chrome. The user explicitly chose
to keep the Chrome button and Facebook's native **Tiếp tục** confirmation. Shopee
opened its offers landing; the exact original Android TikTok source opened the
correct T20 shared card, followed by the native **Xem mặt hàng** gesture to the
full PDP. Article return, countdown, cooldown-zero reload and two accepted local
affiliate clicks per original trial passed. Six tested source hashes matched.
iOS is automated-only; production deployment, database counts and commission
attribution are separate checks.
